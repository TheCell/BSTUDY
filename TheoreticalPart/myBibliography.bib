@article{VanderLinden2014,
abstract = {The use of procedural content generation (PCG) techniques in game development has been mostly restricted to very specific types of game elements. PCG has seldom been deployed for generating entire game levels, a notable exception to this being dungeons: a specific type of game level often encountered in adventure and role playing games. Due to their peculiar combination of pace, gameplay, and game spaces, dungeon levels are among the most suited to showcase the benefits of PCG. This paper surveys research on procedural methods to generate dungeon game levels. We summarize common practices, discuss pros and cons of different approaches, and identify a few promising challenges ahead. In general, what current procedural dungeon generation methods are missing is not performance, but more powerful, accurate, and richer control over the generation process. Recent research results seem to indicate that gameplay-related criteria can provide this high-level control. However, this area is still in its infancy, and many research challenges still lie ahead, e.g., improving the intuitiveness and accessibility of such methods for designers. We also observe that more research is needed into generic mechanisms for automating the generation of the actual dungeon-geometric models. We conclude that the foundations for enabling gameplay-based control of dungeon-level generation are worth being researched, and that its promising results may be instrumental in bringing PCG into mainstream game development.},

Its aim is to efficiently disseminate original research results in informatics in printed and electronic form. While the focus is on publication of peer-reviewed full papers presenting mature work, inclusion of reviewed short papers and abstracts reporting on work in progress is welcome, too. Besides globally relevant meetings with internationally representative program committees guaranteeing a strict peer-reviewing and paper selection process, conferences run by societies or of high regional or national relevance are considered for publication as well. The topical scope of CCIS spans the entire spectrum of informatics ranging from foundational topics in the theory of computing to information and communications science and technology and a broad variety of interdisciplinary application fields. Publication in CCIS is free of charge. No royalties are paid; however, CCIS volume editors receive 25 complimentary copies of the proceedings. CCIS proceedings can be published in time for distribution at conferences or as post-proceedings, as printed books and/or electronically as CDs; furthermore CCIS proceedings are included in the CCIS electronic book series hosted in the SpringerLink digital library. The language of publication is exclusively English. Authors publishing in CCIS have to sign the Springer CCIS copyright transfer form, however, they are free to use their material published in CCIS for substantially changed, more elaborate subsequent publications elsewhere. For the preparation of the camera-ready papers/files, authors have to strictly adhere to the Springer CCIS Authors' Instructions and are strongly encouraged to use the CCIS LaTeX style files or templates. --Book Jacket.},

abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game content—from 3D objects to abstract puzzles— plays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difﬁcult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the ﬁrst comprehensive survey of the ﬁeld of PCG-G. We ﬁrst introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole ﬁeld of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future.},

It's a key part of why games like Skyrim and Minecraft are able to attract and retain huge player bases that keep playing years after release. And it's the central pillar upon which Hello Games' much-anticipated No Man's Sky rests. But procgen can be easily misunderstood or misused, and the idea of designing algorithms to create chunks of your game on the fly may not come naturally. So we've consulted with some smart developers and assembled this list of games that use the technique in interesting or distinct ways.

abstract = {How do you create 100 square km of wilderness with a terrain changing every day? One of the challenges with a modern open world is its sheer size. Not every square meter of the world will receive the attention of a level artist or a level designer. Yet while filling empty space is easy, creating natural-looking environments is a bigger challenge. Ubisoft's solution on 'Far Cry 5' was to develop a set of procedural tools to generate biomes, texture the terrain, setup freshwater networks, generate cliff rocks and more. Procedural technical artist {\'{E}}tienne Carrier walks you through how they tacked this challenge...},

The gates to Oblivion have been opened and hellish Daedra pour out to ravage the land. At the center of it all? You. A doomed prisoner set free by chance. Will you use your second chance at life to save Cyrodiil from a terrible fate, or answer the call of another destiny? In this game, you are sent fourth to try and find the last remaining heir to the throne who is hidden because he is illegitimate, yet still possesses the necessary blood to restore order to the land. While this is the main story, the game is incredibly open in that there are many villages, all with quests that need not relate to the primary goals.},
