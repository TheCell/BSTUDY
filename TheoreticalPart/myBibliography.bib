abstract = {How do you create 100 square km of wilderness with a terrain changing every day? One of the challenges with a modern open world is its sheer size. Not every square meter of the world will receive the attention of a level artist or a level designer. Yet while filling empty space is easy, creating natural-looking environments is a bigger challenge. Ubisoft's solution on 'Far Cry 5' was to develop a set of procedural tools to generate biomes, texture the terrain, setup freshwater networks, generate cliff rocks and more. Procedural technical artist {\'{E}}tienne Carrier walks you through how they tacked this challenge...},
