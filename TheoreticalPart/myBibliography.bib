abstract = {In the right game — Diablo, Rogue, Spelunky, Daggerfall, Elite, Spore, even the likes of Football Manager — procedurally-generated content is magical. It elevates the design and highlights the elegance of the core system loops. It can save you time and earn you money. It's a key part of why games like Skyrim and Minecraft are able to attract and retain huge player bases that keep playing years after release. And it's the central pillar upon which Hello Games' much-anticipated No Man's Sky rests. But procgen can be easily misunderstood or misused, and the idea of designing algorithms to create chunks of your game on the fly may not come naturally. So we've consulted with some smart developers and assembled this list of games that use the technique in interesting or distinct ways. Each of the games below uses procgen to great effect, and studying them further might help you come up with ways to develop better games through generative algorithms.},

abstract = {The CCIS series is devoted to the publication of proceedings of computer science conferences. Its aim is to efficiently disseminate original research results in informatics in printed and electronic form. While the focus is on publication of peer-reviewed full papers presenting mature work, inclusion of reviewed short papers and abstracts reporting on work in progress is welcome, too. Besides globally relevant meetings with internationally representative program committees guaranteeing a strict peer-reviewing and paper selection process, conferences run by societies or of high regional or national relevance are considered for publication as well. The topical scope of CCIS spans the entire spectrum of informatics ranging from foundational topics in the theory of computing to information and communications science and technology and a broad variety of interdisciplinary application fields. Publication in CCIS is free of charge. No royalties are paid; however, CCIS volume editors receive 25 complimentary copies of the proceedings. CCIS proceedings can be published in time for distribution at conferences or as post-proceedings, as printed books and/or electronically as CDs; furthermore CCIS proceedings are included in the CCIS electronic book series hosted in the SpringerLink digital library. The language of publication is exclusively English. Authors publishing in CCIS have to sign the Springer CCIS copyright transfer form, however, they are free to use their material published in CCIS for substantially changed, more elaborate subsequent publications elsewhere. For the preparation of the camera-ready papers/files, authors have to strictly adhere to the Springer CCIS Authors' Instructions and are strongly encouraged to use the CCIS LaTeX style files or templates. --Book Jacket.},

abstract = {Hundreds of millions of people play computer games every day. For them, game content—from 3D objects to abstract puzzles— plays a major entertainment role. Manual labor has so far ensured that the quality and quantity of game content matched the demands of the playing community, but is facing new scalability challenges due to the exponential growth over the last decade of both the gamer population and the production costs. Procedural Content Generation for Games (PCG-G) may address these challenges by automating, or aiding in, game content generation. PCG-G is difﬁcult, since the generator has to create the content, satisfy constraints imposed by the artist, and return interesting instances for gamers. Despite a large body of research focusing on PCG-G, particularly over the past decade, ours is the ﬁrst comprehensive survey of the ﬁeld of PCG-G. We ﬁrst introduce a comprehensive, six-layered taxonomy of game content: bits, space, systems, scenarios, design, and derived. Second, we survey the methods used across the whole ﬁeld of PCG-G from a large research body. Third, we map PCG-G methods to game content layers; it turns out that many of the methods used to generate game content from one layer can be used to generate content from another. We also survey the use of methods in practice, that is, in commercial or prototype games. Fourth and last, we discuss several directions for future research in PCG-G, which we believe deserve close attention in the near future.},
